# Thesis_Code_Challenge

Hello! 

I did the following mockup implementation using custom HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

** Note: I initially wanted to use Sass but my compiler was giving me a lot of trouble. For reference to some examples of Sass in use, please reference either my Gallery Page in progress: https://github.com/DDarrow123/Gallery_Page or my revamped website: https://github.com/DDarrow123/New_Website_2019. 

In terms of media queries, in the interest of time, I did basic queries to demonstrate my knowledge and use of them. Please note that the Services section does need more work but the general idea is there. 

In terms of flaws, I would say that where the green drop down arrow is can be confusing to a user. Is the whole image behind it going to drop down as the user clicks the arrow or is it simply supposed to nagivate to another portion of the page? Maybe the statment above the arrow could be clearer as well as to where the user will be taken upon clicking. 

Instructions: 

1. Clone the repository and git clone it into a newly created folder in your terminal (`mkdir <folder name>`)
2. `cd` into Thesis_Code_Challenge
3. `cd` into the 'public' folder 
4. Here you will see the index.html file - to run this, simply run the command: `open index.html` You should see the site running locally

I hope you enjoy!
