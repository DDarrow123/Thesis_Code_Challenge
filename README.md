# Thesis_Code_Challenge

Hello! 

I did the following mockup implementation using custom HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

** Note: I initially wanted to use Sass but my compiler was given me a lot of trouble (go figure). For reference to Sass, please reference either my Gallery Page in progress: https://github.com/DDarrow123/Gallery_Page or my revamped website: https://github.com/DDarrow123/New_Website_2019. 

In terms of media queries, in the interest of time, I did basic queries to demonstrate my knowledge and use of them. Please note that the Services section does need more work but the general idea is there. 

I hope you enjoy!
